# Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Public Cloud Trial

---

## Welcome to the **Cloudera Data Engineering** tutorial! 

---
In this hands-on experience, you'll dive into the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) service , an essential component of the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) that simplifies large-scale batch processing with Apache Spark, Airflow, and Iceberg.


Throughout these labs, you are going to deploy an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) data pipeline that extracts data stored on AWS S3 object storage, loads it into the Cloudera Data Lakehouse and transforms it for reporting purposes.

## About the Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) Service

CDE is the Cloudera Data Engineering Service, a containerized managed service for Cloudera Data Platform designed for Large Scale Batch Pipelines with Spark, Airflow and Iceberg. It allows you to submit batch jobs to auto-scaling virtual clusters. As a Cloud-Native service, CDE enables you to spend more time on your applications, and less time on infrastructure.

CDE allows you to create, manage, and schedule Apache Spark jobs without the overhead of creating and maintaining Spark clusters. With CDE, you define virtual clusters with a range of CPU and memory resources, and the cluster scales up and down as needed to run your Spark workloads, helping to control your cloud costs.
