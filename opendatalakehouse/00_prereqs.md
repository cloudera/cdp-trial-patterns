# 00_prereqs

As part of the `Prerequisites`, we will walk through the initial setup and configuration steps needed in your environment before we can proceed with the `Ingest` phase labs, including:

- Decide on a unique **Prefix** that will identify the databases you will create
- Deploy a new Machine Learning (ML) project
- Configure and deploy an Applied Machine Learning Prototype (AMP)


# Cloudera Machine Learning (CML) Project

In this phase, we will be deploying an end\-to\-end machine learning project that will also be used in the [03_predict](04_predict) phases.

## Lab 1: Configure and Deploy an AMP

1. Open Cloudera AI

    - Select the `Machine Learning` tile on the CDP Home page
    
        > Note: If you are not already at the CDP Home Page, click the bento menu icon in the top left corner, then click on `Home`

    - From the Machine Learning home page, click on the available Workspace (found under the `Workspace` column). 

    - Make note of the `Workspace/Environment` value listed as you will need to enter this value later on

2. Click `AMPs` in the left menu

3. You will see a catalog of available Machine Learning Prototypes

4. Search for the Canceled Flight Prediction prototype by entering `cancel` into the **Search AMPs** box and clicking the prototype tile

5. Now click the `Configure & Deploy` button at the bottom-left

6. On the next screen, you are presented with **Environment Variable** values to fill in.

   > Note: For this step, you will need to choose a unique **prefix** that will identify the databases you will create and reference in the other labs (e.g. `evolve`)

     ![Screen_Shot_AMP_Configuration_Settings.png](images/Screen_Shot_AMP_Configuration_Settings.png)

    Fill out the form as noted below:

    - **STORAGE_MODE:** `local`
    - **SPARK_CONNECTION_NAME:** `<use the Workspace/Environment value we captured earlier>`
    - **DW_DATABASE:** `<prefix>_airlines` (e.g. prefix = evolve)
    - **DW_TABLE:** `flights`
    - **USE_PREBUILT_MODEL:** `no`
    - **Enable Spark:** `<click the toggle button to enable Spark>`

    - Leave the rest of the fields with their default values.

7. Click the `Launch Project` button at the bottom-right

    - It takes a few minutes to run the Jobs to build and deploy an end\-to\-end machine learning project

    - CML will automatically execute the following 10 steps:

        `Step 1:` Job to install dependencies

        `Step 2:` Running the install dependencies job

        `Step 3:` Job to process the raw data files

        `Step 4:` Running job to process raw data files

        `Step 5:` Job to train the model

        `Step 6:` Run the model training job

        `Step 7:` Create the flight delay prediction model API endpoint

        `Step 8:` Build the model

        `Step 9:` Deploy the model

        `Step 10:` Start the Application

    - You can follow the executed step by clicking on the `View details` page to see the progress and what the prototype execution looks like in the background.

    - All the steps above should be successful before proceeding to the next steps. It takes roughly 8 minutes for the prototype to be deployed. You should see a `Completed all steps` message above the executed steps.

Congratulations! You've completed your first lab!
